Display updating works only with line in Chrome, i.e. you first have to set type and then select line. In FF, both update.

Saving transcriptions works only in Chrome.

Splitting a line across several lines and saving them in translations brings different errors:

Error while parsing XML: The element type "br" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</br>". 
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The element type "br" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</br>".

This comes from <br _moz_dirty=""> in FF which is not closed, html-wise.

In Chrome, it only happens if you copy & paste.

Error while parsing XML: The entity "nbsp" was referenced, but not declared. 
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The entity "nbsp" was referenced, but not declared.

This happens in Chrome and Safari.

Opera raises no errors, but does not save.
