Display updating works only with line in Chrome, i.e. you first have to set type and then select line. In FF, both update.

Saving transcriptions works only in Chrome.

Saving translations brings different errors:

Error while parsing XML: The element type "br" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</br>". 
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The element type "br" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</br>".

This comes from <br _moz_dirty=""> in FF.

In Chrome, it only happens if you copy & paste.

Error while parsing XML: The entity "nbsp" was referenced, but not declared. 
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The entity "nbsp" was referenced, but not declared.

This happens in Chrome.
